webaudiox.js
============
it is a webaudio api ala vendor.js.
no libs only snippets for you to copy, and fine tune to your own needs.

## TODO
* port examples from webaudio.js
* should i do a build/webaudio-bundle.js ?
* webaudiox.contextx.js seems weird and obsolete
  * maybe webaudiox.boilerplate.js ? seems more like a boilerplate
  * it is .lineout.js + loadbuffer.js + mutewithvisibility.js
  * mutewithvisibility.js is in contextx.js too! duplicate 

* DONE put in its own repo
* done fix the naming issue
  * one WebAudioX.ContextX
  * one WebAudioX.AbsoluteNormalizer
* done port all the three.js localisation
  * webaudiox.three.js
  * put a panner
  * put some dopler
